Many of your PatronManager (or NPSP!) users might not be a user of email to Salesforce...and you should be! Here's an email I wrote to my users, slightly edited for the web!

When you enable Email-to-Salesforce, you'll receive a very long and non-sense email address. They look something like emailtosalesforce@2-13p6dtqblis22rox74jy537z28gfdsafd6tgb3rzfas6rl.f-5h45mae.na10.le.salesforce.com. Whenever you email someone a communication we might want to track (an ask, an invitation, response to some feedback, etc...) you can just bcc that address, and your email to them will be stored in their record on SalesForce!

To set it up, select the My Settings dropdown under your name:

Then select My Email-to-salesforce:

And you'll want your settings set something like mine:

This will also give you a REALLY USEFUL FEATURE for contacting people!

See that lil "Gmail" icon next to Kevin's email? Just hit that, and it will pop up a Gmail compose window to Kevin, with the bcc address all set up. Write your email, and move right on. You don't even need to think about emailing SalesForce when you're starting from within the system!
