### What's a humanist?
> Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize common human needs, and seek solely rational ways of solving human problems.

I hope you'd agree that your not-for-profit values human beings!

### So why am I wasting my time on data?

It's the plight of any small (but mighty!) not-for-profit organization. We work 150% of the time we have to accomplish our mission, realize our vision, and uphold our values. How do we give up hours of useful staff time, not to mention money toward a provider and consultant, when we could use those resources to expand a program? The incredible Vu Le, executive director of [Rainier Valley Corps][1], blogging over at [Nonprofit with Balls][2] writes about the Capacity Paradox:

> The Capacity Paradox is when an organization cannot get significant funding because it has limited capacity, so it cannot develop its capacity, which leads it to not being able to get significant funding, which means it can’t develop its capacity. This greatly affects organizations led by communities of color and other marginalized communities. And then they can’t be as involved, which leads to ineffective efforts to tackle issues.

Already, you're feeling this lack of capacity, and I'm asking you to dedicate even more of your resources to non-program related projects? Am I crazy? 

Having a big picture view of your constituencies and their engagement, as you will learn, is an invaluable resource. But today I want to focus on one benefit and how Salesforce can help you. 

### A culture of appreciation.

You're a public charity. You take credit card donations, you get checks in the mail, and all sorts of other contributed revenues. Your development coordinator does a fantastic job thanking your donors for every gift they make.

You rely on volunteers to execute some of your most successful programs. Your volunteer manager spends a few hours every week sending out emails to remind people of their upcoming shifts and to thank them for their work last month.

You even have a drip marketing campaign set up to re-engage your program attendees and to thank them for coming out on a Wednesday night to take a class.

You're doing everything right. Your organization has a culture of appreciation. Each department thanks their constituencies with an alarming efficiency and everybody goes on with their day.

It's okay if you aren't at that point in your org yet. Either way, some well integrated CRM
