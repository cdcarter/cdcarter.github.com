It's a common request, especially from Development Directors who came from Blackbaud products.

Well now you can:

Don't worry, it's not Lightning only, it works right in your regular old Salesforce page layouts:

[Caroline Renard](http://www.carolinerenard.com/) saw [a blog post](http://www.spotlightonsalesforce.com/blog/2015/8/7/cleaning-up-fields-on-a-contact-record-need-better-title) by [Michelle Paul](http://twitter.com/fuzzydinosaur) and [Allison Klein](http://twitter.com/nyalli) where they used an old bit of [Evan Callahan](http://twitter.com/groundwired)'s [Groundwire Base](https://github.com/Groundwire/GWBase/).

Caroline asked me "what would it take to re-implement that, show record types, and make it work with the NPSP and PatronManager?" I replied "a donation to [TeenTix](http://teentix.org), a weekend, and I'll throw in soft credit display as well." And like that, it came together, and it's [open source](https://github.com/cdcarter/SalesforceDonationHistory) and freely available for your organization!

Interested in installing it? [Follow the directions here](http://cdcarter.github.io/SalesforceDonationHistory/install.html). And look forward to a blog post next week which will describe how you can customize it even further to show more than one grid per page with different summaries!
