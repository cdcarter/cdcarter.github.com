*This blog post was written at the conclusion of the 2015 PatronManager Community Meeting, as a follow up to a presentation I did with Caroline Renard about using the Salesforce1 mobile app. Nothing here is PatronManager specific.*

So you want to get started with the mobile app. Your executive director downloaded it to his phone and declared it useless. You know how to find contacts in it...but you don't actually do it. Let's dig in and talk about two techniques and things you need to know in order to make Salesforce1 useful to your organization.

# Page Layouts
## Compact Layout
## Field Order

# Actions
## The action bar
## Log a call and chatter posts
## A custom action?
