I'm experimenting with [sketchnotes](http://rohdesign.com/sketchnotes/), and I thought why not start writing up all the different places you can use Apex code. I count about 24 different Apex contexts you can use, but there may be more. I'll update this post with more drawings as I do more!

"The problem is all inside your head" Marc said to me
"The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to call your Apex"

Parker said "It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to call your Apex
Fifty ways to call your Apex"

Use Visualforce, of course
Use batch jobs, Rob.
Launch a flow, bro
Just run that code
How bout a report, Bort?
You don't need to implement much
Just a post-refresh, Beth
And don't hold your breath!
