It's season building season, which means every Box Office Manager for PatronManager is putting in headphones and spending long hours creating ticketable events, event instances, and sometimes even their own subscription packages. It's a great feeling to finish the big build and have everything ready to go on sale. You've gone over every price level three times, and you've tested the packages through Create Ticket Order in Salesforce. The final step is making sure your public ticketing websites have the right content and *look* right!

Nothing feels worse than setting those packages to be on sale, and the sidebar looks ridiculous. I can never remember what sidebar will show up on what screen of the ticketing pages, and I also can never tell if I've got spacing just right or completely wrong. 

Here's a quick trick I shared with the Seattle PatronManager User Group. If you put your events on-sale and active, but mark the allocations as private, you can add an access code to see what it'll look like on your ticketins site!

Here's a show we have set as private:

When you go to the ticketing link, nothing will show up:

When you go to the access code link, there are your events ready to be tested out just by you!

If you wanna get real pro,  add that access code link to your custom links and you can get there in seconds.

This way, you can have some knowledge that your tickets will look the way you expect when you go on sale!
