Sometimes, I spend all my time looking for the "best" solution. For me, this often results in two things:

  1. The solution I identify is flawed.
  2. I spend way too much time looking for that solution!
  
Now, this certainly proves I always have a LOT to learn. It also shows that in the #AccidentalAdmin sector, sometimes you want to look for Second Bests. Things that might not be 100% the perfect way of solving a problem, but when you want to get back to focusing on your programs, you just need something that works! As admins in not-for-profit, we often don't have the time to build a perfect Flow unless we want to give up our freetime. Some projects are fun, and we choose to do that. Some projects, we just have to get done.

Here are a few of my recent "second bests"

### Ask Amounts on the Household
Instead of using an Opportunity to track Major Gift cultivation, we've started using custom fields on the Account. Instead of creating a new Opportunity for every prospect, we just pull a report of major givers over the past four years. As we look at that list, we can add ask info as appropriate, and use Chatter on the Account to track what we're doing. We didn't need the heavy reporting/forecasting that Opportunities would give us, so we don't bother with the setup time.
