I spent the first YEAR of my time on Salesforce without knowing about the Filter Logic feature on reports. I passed my Certified Administrator and Developer exams without knowing about the Filter Logic feature on reports. I built MANY an unnecessary formula checkbox field because I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE FILTER LOGIC FEATURE ON REPORTS

In short, I am very embarassed I didn't know about this. But if I didn't know about it for this long, maybe you didn't either.
