In the tradition of awesome formula image tricks, I wanted to introduce [shields.io](http://shields.io/), an awesome service you maybe have seen used on Github repositories.

It might express a version:

[![homebrew](https://img.shields.io/homebrew/v/cake.svg)]()

or the build status: 

[![Shippable](https://img.shields.io/shippable/5444c5ecb904a4b21567b0ff.svg)]()

Shields are useful, because you just drop an image link in in your README and they render. Wait a second, can't we drop an image link in a formula field and see something cool? We've done that before with [Da Button Factory](https://dabuttonfactory.com), let's try it with a shield.

At first, I thought let's try a shield as the record header!

It looks nice. Hell, Matt Bertuzzi, author of [Lightning Sales Ops](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XMR93HC) wrote:

and it's easy to implement:

    HYPERLINK(
        "#/sObject/"&Id&"/view",
        IMAGE(
            "https://img.shields.io/badge/" & 
              SUBSTITUTE(Account__r.Name," ","_") & 
              "-" & 
              TEXT(Duration__c) & 
              "hrs-ignored.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=0070d2", 
            Account__r.Name & " - " & TEXT(Duration__c) & "hrs"),
        "_self")
        
That said, I'm just not sold on this as the best place to use shields in my Salesforce app. I know, I know, I have a solution in search of a problem.

I hopped on a screenshare with [Jason Lett](https://twitter.com/jasonblett), a Product Manager at CrowdCompass, and demo'd what I'd built. We talked about how this shield could be hard to read in a list view. After all, the two sections will be different sizes! 

We talked for a while, and he made sure to ask me important questions about the context in which these shields would be seen. Ultimately, a shield could work well as a record handle, but you'd have to be careful where you use it. For time entries, we considered the front portion could be a well formatted date. Meh.

But as we were looking at [themes throughout the app](http://www.designkit.org/methods/5), there were a lot of user stories where we wanted to link out to a filtered report. This is a long time Salesforce "best of the rest" feature, that in Spring 17 is officially supported. [Beth Bresines](https://twitter.com/bethbrains) wrote up a fantastic post about how to build a report link in Lighting and how to make it work in classic too [on the Bigger Boat Blog](http://biggerboatconsulting.com/supporting-report-filter-url-hacks-in-lightning-and-classic/).

I love this technique, but is "This Account's Opportunities" really the best way to show what you're linking off to? 

## Introducing Report Shields

[![shield](http://i.imgur.com/xydtt23.png)]()

Instead of just linking to a report, how about we use a button in order to make it clearer that this is something you can click on and get more details? In fact, what if our app established that a shield means you're going to a place where you see more detail?

A shield for "This Account's Opportunities" (or in my timesheet app, "Account Hours Breakdown") would be a little bit more visible than a link, right? 

Wait, but a shield has a second component. Not just a label, but...something on the right. A value. 

We all know that [Lightning Components are data aware](http://www.tahoedreamin.com/sessions/take-action-lightning/). Well, here's a declarative field you can build that's data aware too. Let's build a shield that links to the hours report, but shows the total too.

I built a simple rollup on Account for how many hours had been billed. The criteria for this rollup must EXACTLY match the criteria for your report's grand total, but that's okay.

I then built a detail report that would show the hours breakdown for that account with a grand total:

[![report](http://i.imgur.com/8mXaBdn.png)]()

Notice how we add a filter but leave the value blank, as described in Beth's post! Then, we create our Report Shield formula field:

    HYPERLINK(
        "#/sObject/<YOUR REPORT ID>/view?fv0=" & Id,
        IMAGE(
          "https://img.shields.io/badge/Hours_Breakdown-" &
            TEXT(Hours_billed__c) &
            "_hrs-ignored.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=0070d2",
          "link to account report"),"_self")
          
Boom, we now have a report button that also can tell us a little bit more about what we're gonna see when we click through.
