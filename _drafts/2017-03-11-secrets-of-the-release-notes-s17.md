Doing secrets of the release notes isn't just an excuse for me to write my blog post two months after everyone else but not look lazy. It's 

I like to highlight:

- new design patterns trhat talk to us about the feature of the app
- those little changes that mean a lot
- fgeatures that amde it into the release notes late and I don't hear being talked about much
- and new features that are *free* with your grant that used to cost money

Okay, I wouldn't call this new feature a "secret" but like literally what the fuck. if you're using Outlook365 or Gmail for email and your reps aren't using the plugin go fuck yourselgf

the secret might be it's available for platform users now

Nobody has made a compelling Einstein pitch to me and I don't think another 60 minute webinar with four slides and a Journey Builder is gonna help me.

Lightning got Folders, which replace Libraries. Cool. Content is pretty much dead and we just have Files now. That's good!

That simple case feature gets a notch. I have a long standing hate for Case for licensing concerns and don't support nonprofits using it openly. But I recently fell in love with the EA&C license and internal cases make things liek this kinda nice. don't mock.

You still can't put an app or component in a force.com site. it's a bitch. but you can finally do it in a public facing community. To do this, you need a single community login. that's not expensive. you get all of community builder for public pages and your custom apps too. public knowledge base if you have a single knowlsge author license. h/t jodie miners.  gurl write a book abt this.

somewhere deep inside salesforce another team is developing a household model. they're developing relationships. They're rebuilding things the NPSP has already but also trying new things. it's neat to watch. I wonder if they know we exist. They get flashy marketing, but they can only release three times a year and the NPSP releases every other week. suck a disk, financial services cloud.
admittedly their app is a lot more individual focused than like we just gotta enter gifts. it's neat
