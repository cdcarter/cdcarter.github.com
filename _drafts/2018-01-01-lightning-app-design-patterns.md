In 1977, Christopher Alexander and the Center for Environmental Structure in Berkeley, California published _A Pattern Language_. The premise of the book required a radical transformation of the architectural profession, and presented a language of 253 patterns that everyday people could use to describe, design, and construct the homes and buildings in which they wished to dwell. Each pattern is an answer to a design problem, a solution that the team at the Center collected in their eight years of study. How does the book work? In Alexander's own words

> All 253 patterns together form a language. They create a coherent picture of an entire region, with the power to generate such regions in a million forms, with infinite variety in all the details. 
> It is also true that any small sequence of patterns from this language is itself a language for a smaller part of the environment; and this small list of patterns is then capable of generating a million parks, paths, houses, workshops, or gardens.

The patterns are thus both prescriptive (they offer one solution to a specific problem) but also composable. One of the members of the Center created a small porch at the front of the house. 

* **PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)**
* **SUNNY PLACE (161)**
* **OUTDOOR ROOM (163)**
* **SIX FOOT BALCONY (167)**
* **COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)**
* **FRONT DOOR BENCH (242)**
* **RAISED FLOWERS (245)**

The designer selected a set of patterns that resonated with him, and working through from more creational/structural to more embellishments. It's almost a beautiful little MVP and iterations ;).

Over time, the professional software development community started to explore a concept of design patterns, inspired by Alexander's work. However, in practice, they are mostly patterns without a language. They are implementation focused. They are often about how the code will do something, or adding a layer of abstraction for consistency. Patterns like **factories** and **builders** are what come to mind. In the Salesforce world, we see Enterprise Application Patterns like **Selector**, **Domain Layer**, and **Service Layer**.

This work is valuable, but these are patterns for a team of software engineers to work together to build something. These are patterns that a team uses to design the inner mechanics of an application, and somewhat presupposes that the requirements are either unequivocably correct, or just don't matter at all! Indeed, there is a legitimate level of design in the way a complex code base achieves whatever it needs to achieve, regardless of that goal. But the original goal of A Pattern Language talks about a higher level design. The design that the "user" or dweller interacts with on an everyday basis -- not the details of the build of the engineered floor. How does the dweller relate to their dwelling? What are the patterns we can give them so that they can design a dwelling that works for them?

We need a pattern language not just for the architecture of the code or the servers that make it possible, but also for the actual design of end user applications. The Lightning Platform empowered business analysts and citizen developers to build applications for their organizations. Many of these are powerful, and many of them would benefit from using peer vetted patterns that can allow them to create an impactful application experience that will be maintainable.

Alexander organizes his pattern language in sequence, "moving from larger to smaller, from ones which create structures, to those which then embellish them, to those which embellish the embellishments". The first patterns are for a region, then a city or town, then subcommunities, then neighborhoods, then individual dwellings, then the makeup and decor of those dwellings.

You can imagine a pattern language for Lighting. By moving through patterns in groups like:

* platforms and/or clouds
* data model (custom objects and fields)
* automation and business logic
* application experience and navigation
* layout and action

and using the rapid application development toolkit provided by the Lightning Platform, a business user and a cictizen developer should be able to work together in tandem to prototype, validate, and quickly implement an application.

Over the years, I've been writing about patterns for [frosting][1], [reporting][2], [data modeling][4], and even for [what parts of Salesforce to build your app on, and what to avoid][3]. As I see more and more admins and developers attempt to transition their orgs and business processes to the Lightning Experience, I see a need for a more holistic pattern language for Lightning Application design. A year ago, at Tahoe Dreamin' I presented on a number of patterns that were available then, about two years into the Lightning Experience. With another year's worth of building, learning, and improvements to the platform, I think its time to start collecting those patterns into a language.
