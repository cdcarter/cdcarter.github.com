Here is some work that I've been able to share with the community.

* [Donation History Grid](https://github.com/cdcarter/SalesforceDonationHistory) -- a highly configurable page layout component that shows year over year donation history for your constituents.
* [Top Campaign in Hierarchy](https://github.com/cdcarter/TopCampaignInHierarchy) -- This is a very simple package that provides tools to access the top-most campaign in a hierarchy.
* [Volunteers For PatronManager](https://github.com/cdcarter/VolunteersForPatronManager) -- This is some ALPHA status software to make creating V4SF shifts based on PatronManager events easier.
* [Volunteers for Salesforce (contributions)](https://github.com/cdcarter/Volunteers-for-Salesforce) -- I am an active contributor to David Habib's [Volunteers for Salesforce](http://djhconsulting.com/volunteers-for-salesforce/). I've submitted patches to fix minor bugs, add Google Maps to the public sites, and handle Campaign Hierarchy. I'm currently working on a pull request to help volunteer managers automatically mark confirmed shifts as completed, as well as a "Health Check" to make setup and installation easier.
* [Nonprofit Starter Pack 3.0 (contributions)](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/Cumulus) -- I am an active contributor to the Salesforce Foundation's NPSP 3.0. I have bug fixes related to the payment wizard and the geolocation features, and I am currently working on a set of patches to help the ongoing non-english translations project. I participated in the 2015 Community Sprint.
