Here is some work that I've been able to share with the community.

* [Top Campaign in Hierarchy](https://github.com/cdcarter/TopCampaignInHierarchy) -- This is a very simple package that provides tools to access the top-most campaign in a hierarchy.
* [Volunteers For PatronManager](https://github.com/cdcarter/VolunteersForPatronManager) -- This is some ALPHA status software to make creating V4SF shifts based on PatronManager events easier.
* [Volunteers for Salesforce (contributions)](https://github.com/cdcarter/Volunteers-for-Salesforce) -- I am an active contributor to David Habib's [Volunteers for Salesforce](http://djhconsulting.com/volunteers-for-salesforce/). I've submitted patches to fix minor bugs, add Google Maps to the publiic sites, and handle Campaign Hierarchy.
